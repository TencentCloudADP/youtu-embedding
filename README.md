## 🎯 Brief Introduction

<img src="assets/rag_logo.png" alt="Youtu-RAG Logo" width="140" align="left" style="margin-right:20px;">

**Youtu-Embedding** is an industry-leading, general-purpose text representation model developed by Tencent Youtu Lab. It demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks, including Information Retrieval (IR), Semantic Textual Similarity (STS), Clustering, Reranking, and Classification.

The core advantages of Youtu-Embedding can be summarized as follows:

  - **🏆 State-of-the-Art Performance**: Achieved a top score of **77.46**  on the authoritative Chinese text embedding benchmark CMTEB (as of Sep 2025), proving its powerful representation capabilities.

  - **🧠 Sophisticated Three-Stage Training:** We pioneered a "LLM-based Pre-training → Weakly-supervised Alignment → Collaborative-Discriminative Fine-tuning" pipeline, which systematically distills the broad knowledge of large language models into the specialized discriminative power required for embedding tasks.

  - **⭐ Innovative Fine-tuning Framework**: We designed a unique Collaborative-Discriminative Fine-tuning Framework that effectively resolves the "negative transfer" problem in multi-task learning through a unified data format, task-differentiated loss functions, and a dynamic single-task sampling mechanism. (This framework has been verified on a variety of basic encoders to ensure its versatility and effectiveness.)

  - **🛠️ Meticulous Data Engineering**: We combined high-quality, LLM-based data synthesis with efficient hard negative mining strategies to provide the most robust data foundation for model training.

<a id="quickstart"></a>
## 🚀 Quickly Start Inference
You can generate embeddings in two ways: via our official API for ease of use or by running the model locally for full control.

### Option 1: ☁️ Using the Official API
**📦 Install the SDK** 

```bash
pip install --upgrade tencentcloud-sdk-python
```
  * **API Guide**: For details on authentication and endpoints, see the [Tencent Cloud API Documentation](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1772/115343).
  * **SDK Reference**: For more on the SDK, refer to the [SDK Installation Guide](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/sdk).

**⚙️ Usage**

 * Please see the script in [`usage/tencent_cloud_api.py`](usage/tencent_cloud_api.py).

### Option 2: 💻 Locally with Self-Hosted Inference
Running the model on your own machine gives you full control, making it perfect for offline use, customization, or when data privacy is a priority. Here are a few popular ways to get started.

#### 1. Using the Custom `LLMEmbeddingModel` Class
For a more specialized implementation or to see our direct wrapper, you can use the `LLMEmbeddingModel` class.

  * See the complete example script here: [`usage/infer_llm_embedding.py`](usage/infer_llm_embedding.py).

#### 2. Using `sentence-transformers`
**📦 Installation**
```bash
pip install sentence-transformers==5.1.0
```
**⚙️ Usage**
```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

model = SentenceTransformer("model_id")
queries = ["What's the weather like?"]
passages = [
    'The weather is lovely today.',
    "It's so sunny outside!",
    'He drove to the stadium.'
]
queries_embeddings = model.encode_query(queries)
passages_embeddings = model.encode_document(passages)

similarities = model.similarity(queries_embeddings, passages_embeddings)
print(similarities)
```

#### 3. Using `LangChain` 🦜
Easily integrate the model into your **LangChain** applications, such as RAG pipelines.

**📦 Installation**

```bash
pip install langchain==0.3.27 langchain-community==0.3.29 langchain-huggingface==0.3.1 sentence-transformers==5.1.0 faiss-cpu==1.11.0
```

**⚙️ Usage**

 * See this example:  [`usage/langchain_embedding.py`](usage/langchain_embedding.py)

#### 4. Using `LlamaIndex` 🦙
This is perfect for integrating the model into your **LlamaIndex** search and retrieval systems.

**📦 Installation**

```bash
pip install llama-index==0.14.2 llama-index-embeddings-huggingface==0.6.1 sentence-transformers==5.1.0 llama-index-vector-stores-faiss==0.5.1
```

**⚙️ Usage**

 * See this example:  [`usage/llamaindex_embedding.py`](usage/llamaindex_embedding.py)



## 💡 Fine-tuning Framework

We provide our novel **Collaborative-Discriminative Fine-tuning Framework**, designed to overcome the challenges of jointly optimizing different text embedding tasks. By systematically decoupling tasks, we introduce several key innovations to achieve highly efficient unified representation learning.

<strong/>🌐 1. Unified & Extensible Data Format</strong>

  Our unified data structure seamlessly handles heterogeneous data from IR, STS, classification, and reranking tasks, offering excellent extensibility for incorporating new tasks in the future.

<strong/>🎯 2. Task-Differentiated Loss Functions</strong>

We moved beyond a "one-size-fits-all" loss function and designed specialized optimization objectives for different tasks.

- **For IR (Information Retrieval) tasks**: We use a powerful InfoNCE contrastive loss that supports multiple positives, hard negatives, and in-batch cross-device negative sampling for superior discriminative ability.

- **For STS (Semantic Textual Similarity) tasks**: We go beyond simple contrastive learning by adopting ranking-aware objectives (e.g., Pearson loss, KL divergence loss L_RankKL) to directly optimize for ranking consistency.

<strong/>🔄 3. Dynamic Single-Task Sampling</strong>

To prevent gradient interference from mixed-task batches, we implemented a custom dynamic sampler. It ensures that within a single training iteration, all GPUs process non-overlapping shards of the same dataset, providing the model with a pure and stable gradient signal.
